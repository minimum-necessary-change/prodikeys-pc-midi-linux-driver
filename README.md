### UI Application patches

#### PATCH: Fix wxWidgets Unicode Builds
This patch addresses two issues.

1. An issue with building the UI Application against wxWidgets Unicode Builds. (e.g. Ubuntu)
2. An issue with a typo in the Makefile in which, although the application compiles correctly, it cannot be installed due to a malformed path.

Copy the patch to the "pcmidi-controller" directory you previously unpackaged and apply the patch with..

`$ patch -p1 < pcmidi-UI-App-Unicode.patch`

Follow the instructions in the "Kernel driver and UI application" packages to compile and install the UI application.
